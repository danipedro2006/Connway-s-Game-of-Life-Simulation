## General info
Conway's Game of Life is a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) constructed by John Conway in 1970. This simulation starts with an empthy chess like table and has very simple rules. This rules can give birth to a given cell on the board as well as they can wipe out life of a given cell, so elaborate and counterintuitive structures emerge.
